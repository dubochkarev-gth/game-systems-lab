Turn-Based Roguelike Tactical Dungeon Crawler
Design Document (Text-Driven, Expandable)
1. Vision

A turn-based roguelike tactical dungeon crawler with a text-driven RPG interface inspired by games like Roadwarden.

The core focus of the project:

Mechanics-first design

Tactical, readable combat

Dungeon exploration through text and choices

Narrative as a flexible layer, not a hard dependency

The design must remain readable, stable, and expandable without forcing refactors of existing systems.

2. Design Principles

Mechanics Before Narrative
All systems must function without flavor text.

Text as Interface
Player interaction is performed via text and choices, not complex UI widgets.

Deterministic Systems
Combat and progression must be transparent and predictable.

Expandable by Addition
New features are added as layers, not rewrites.

3. Core Gameplay Loop

Main Menu
→ Generate Dungeon
→ Enter Room
→ Read Description
→ Make Choice
→ Resolve Outcome (Combat / Event / Loot)
→ Move to Next Room
→ Death or Exit

This loop is the backbone of the entire project and should never be broken.

4. Game States

The game operates through clearly separated logical states:

Main Menu

Dungeon Exploration

Combat

Event / Narrative Choice

Inventory Interaction

Level Up

Game Over

Each state owns its logic. The UI only reflects the current state.

5. Dungeon System
5.1 Dungeon Structure

A dungeon is a sequence or graph of rooms

Rooms are navigated logically, not spatially

No grid or coordinates are required for MVP

5.2 Room Concept

Each room has:

A type (combat, event, treasure, boss)

A visited flag

Internal randomness for text variation

Rooms do not contain logic — they only describe what kind of encounter happens.

6. Procedural Generation

Dungeon generation rules (MVP):

5–10 rooms per run

First room is always safe

Last room is always a boss

Controlled randomness for room types

Balance and difficulty tuning are explicitly out of scope for MVP.

7. Player Model

The player is defined by:

Health and survivability

Offensive and defensive capability

Initiative (turn order priority)

Experience and level

There are no classes or builds in MVP.

8. Inventory System
8.1 Philosophy

Inventory exists to modify decisions, not to create management overhead.

Small and readable

No sorting or micromanagement

All effects are immediately understandable

8.2 Item Categories

Items fall into broad conceptual categories:

Weapons (offense modifiers)

Armor (defense modifiers)

Consumables (single-use effects)

Relics (passive modifiers)

8.3 Rules

Limited inventory size

One weapon and one armor equipped at a time

Consumables are removed on use

Crafting, rarity tiers, and weight systems are excluded from MVP.

9. Progression & Leveling
9.1 Experience Sources

Experience is gained through:

Combat encounters

Narrative events

9.2 Level Up Flow

Leveling up is presented as a textual choice, not a separate UI system.

Typical level-up rewards:

Increased attack

Increased defense

Increased maximum health

There are no skill trees or long-term builds in MVP.

10. Combat System
10.1 Combat Philosophy

Combat is:

Turn-based

Initiative-driven

Fully text-logged

Combat must be readable and understandable without visual effects.

10.2 Actions

Available combat actions:

Attack

Block

Heal

Each action produces a textual result that is logged and shown to the player.

10.3 Focus System

Focus is a temporary combat resource:

Generated by defensive actions

Automatically consumed on offense

Provides a damage bonus

This system rewards tactical pacing and patience.

10.4 Critical Hits

Flat chance-based system

Damage multiplier on success

Always explicitly logged

10.5 Initiative

Determines action order

Recalculated every round

Designed to be simple and predictable

10.6 Enemy Behavior

Enemies operate using simple internal states:

Aggressive

Defensive

Desperate

State changes are driven by current health thresholds.

11. Narrative & Text Layer
Philosophy

Narrative content never controls mechanics directly.

Text is responsible for:

Describing context

Presenting choices

Communicating outcomes

Later extensions may include conditions, hidden options, and skill checks.

12. UI Concept

The UI is purely text-driven and responsible only for:

Displaying descriptions

Displaying numbered choices

Handling player input

There are no windows, overlays, or complex layouts.

13. MVP Scope
Included

Dungeon generation

Turn-based combat

Inventory system

Leveling and progression

Text-based interface

Excluded

Saving/loading

Meta-progression

Complex builds

World map

14. Planned Extensions

External text files (JSON or similar)

Status effects

Skill checks

Branching narrative events

Equipment synergies

These features must not require changes to the core loop.

15. Design Anchor

When adding any new feature, always ask:

Does this reinforce the core loop and text-driven interaction model?

If the answer is no, the feature does not belong in this project.
