# Ideas Snapshot

This file captures current design directions under consideration.
Nothing here is final. The purpose is preservation, not commitment.

## IDEA A — Session-based Sandbox

**Core thought**  
A session-based game where the player interacts with a living system through information, decisions, and consequences.

**What defines it**
- The world exists and evolves independently of the player
- The player receives signals (news, events, reports)
- Decisions are made based on interpretation, not execution
- Consequences may be delayed or indirect
- Reputation and access are primary forms of progression

**Player experience**
- Understanding what is happening
- Making sense of incomplete information
- Feeling like a participant in a larger system

**Strengths**
- Mechanics-first, minimal reliance on visuals
- Strong fit for text-based events and investigation
- High systemic coherence

**Risks**
- Harder to keep sessions varied
- Combat may become secondary or unnecessary
- Requires clear feedback on consequences

## IDEA B — Hub + Combat Configuration

**Core thought**  
A session-based game where the main interest lies in assembling and refining a functional configuration in a hub, then testing it in combat.

**What defines it**
- Hub as a place for thinking and planning
- Small number of specialized units or archetypes
- Each unit has clear strengths and weaknesses
- Power emerges from combinations, not individual dominance
- Combat serves as validation of the configuration

**Key inspiration**
- Limited but meaningful skill choices
- Strong specialization
- Tactical clarity
- Desire for "magic" as rule modification, not damage

**Player experience**
- Building a team that compensates for its own weaknesses
- Iterating on configurations between sessions
- Learning through failure and adjustment

**Risks**
- Easy to overload with systems
- Risk of becoming a generic tactics roguelike
- Requires very clear combat readability

## Shared Constraints

- Explicit session structure (30–60 minutes)
- Mechanics over graphics
- Clear rules and predictable systems
- Player interest should survive without visual spectacle

## Current State

No active hypothesis selected.
Both ideas are intentionally kept separate.
The next step is to choose one for focused exploration.
