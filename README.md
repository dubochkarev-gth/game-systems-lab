# Systemic Prototype

This repository contains experimental game systems and mechanics.
The focus is on session-based design, clarity of rules, and iteration.
The project is exploratory by nature and may change direction over time.
There is no fixed genre or final game defined yet.
This space is used to think, test, and discard ideas deliberately.
